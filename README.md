## Hi there, I'm Michele Claus ðŸ‘‹
I am a geospatial engineer working in the field of remote sensing, machine learning and cloud computing and related open source projects. I have a background in Computer Vision and worked in this field before.

The image presented above is a view from space of the city of Bolzano (Italy), which combines data from two Copernicus missions: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. It has been generated by me for the [EuroGeo Wokshop 2023](https://egw2023.eurac.edu/) using tools and software I am contributing to develop:

- [openEO](openeo.org):
  - Maintainer of the openEO API back-end infrastructure of Eurac Research available at [openeo.eurac.edu](openeo.eurac.edu)
  - Contributor to several related open-source projects:
    - [openeo-processes-dask](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask) : Xarray and Dask implementation of the openEO processes
    - [openeo-pg-parser-networkx](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-pg-parser-networkx/) : (JSON) openEO process graph parser
    - [openeo-spring-driver](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-spring-driver) : openEO API implementation in Java (Spring)
    - [openeo-python-client](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client) : openEO Python client. Implemented the Client Side Processing functionality.
    - [openeo-test-suite](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-test-suite) : automated testing suite for openEO back-ends
    - [openeo_odc_driver](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo_odc_driver) : containerized (Docker) openEO processing engine
    - [openEO_photovoltaic](https://github.com/clausmichele/openEO_photovoltaic) : mapping photovoltaic panels in the cloud
- [SAR2Cube](https://github.com/SARScripts/preprocess): Sentinel-1 SLC InSAR processing in the cloud, on-the-fly generation of interferometric coherence and more.
- [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en):
  - Main developer of the [raster2stac](https://pypi.org/project/raster2stac/) Python package, which allows the creation of STAC Collection with Items and Assets starting from different kinds of raster datasets. The goal is to make a dataset easily accessible, interoperable, and shareable.

ðŸ“¹ Computer Vision / Deep Learning

- [ViDeNN: Deep Blind Video Denoising](https://github.com/clausmichele/ViDeNN) : tensorflow model to denoise videos affected by different types of degradation, such as Additive White Gaussian Noise and videos in Low-Light conditions.
- [DnCNN: Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser](https://github.com/clausmichele/DnCNN-tensorflow) : Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising. Extended model to RGB [with this PR.](https://github.com/wbhu/DnCNN-tensorflow/pull/32)
